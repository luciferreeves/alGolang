## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You should start by [forking](https://github.com/luciferreeves/alGolang/fork) the repository and then [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#clone-a-repository) the repository into your local machine. You can run the following command to clone the repository into your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

You can then add new algorithms and data structures to the repository in your preferred language to the repository. Please make sure to add your files correctly and in the correct format. A sample of the format is provided below.

```
.
├── Algorithms
│   └── <Language>
│       ├── <Algorithm Name>
│       │   ├── <Algorithm Name>.<Language Extension>
│       │   └── README.md
│       └── <Algorithm Name>
│           ├── <Algorithm Name>.<Language Extension>
│           └── README.md
├── Data Structures
│   └── <Language>
│       ├── <Data Structure Name>
│       │   ├── <Data Structure Name>.<Language Extension>
│       │   └── README.md
